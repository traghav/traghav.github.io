On the 24th of November, 2015, Jeff Bezos took to Twitter to announce the first succesful landing of a reusable rocket. Not a small feat. Bezos' Blue Origin has been working in secret to commoditize space flight since 2000. Their immediate competition being Elon Musk's SpaceX. SpaceX, not so secretly, with varying degrees of success, has been inching closer towards making a reusable rocket.

Now let's take a step back here. Dial back to 1955. A space race between the US and the USSR was beginning. Inspiring two generations and showing a frenzied progress towards space colonization. The Cold War ended, the Space Race died, and as Jeff Hammerbacher puts it, The best minds of our generation were thinking about how to make people click ads.

That changed though, Silicon Valley rebooted the Space Race. Better, leaner and with bigger ego issues than US and USSR combined. We privatized Space Travel. What required the efforts and dreams of two superpowers is now a side business for two billionaires.
