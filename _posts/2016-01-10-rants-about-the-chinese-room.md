It's 2016 already and strong AI is not here yet. We should probably get there. Till we do not, we can endlessly use Philosophy to debate about it. Only problem being, [Newton's flaming laser sword](https://philosophynow.org/issues/46/Newtons_Flaming_Laser_Sword), and that's my beef with most of Philosophy.
