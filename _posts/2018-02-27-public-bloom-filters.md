## What are Bloom Filters?

Bloom Filters are a probablistic data structure that test set membership. [Here is where I first heard about them](https://blog.medium.com/what-are-bloom-filters-1ec2a50c68ff). There are a lot of [really](http://llimllib.github.io/bloomfilter-tutorial/) [good](http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf) [explainers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Probability_of_false_positives) on the interweb.
