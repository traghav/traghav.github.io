# Inspiration


Back when I was designing this website, I really wanted to pick a dark theme for this website. However, all things being equal, dark mode support has lesser readability. I thought of adding a dark mode toggle, but it came at a price of adding at least some clutter. 

With the launch of iOS 13 and Android 10 both baking in dark mode support natively, [many](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/how-to-use-facebook-dark-mode/) [popular](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/08/instagram-android-dark-mode-beta/) [applications](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162387/whatsapp-dark-mode-ios-android-download-features-release-date) have rushed in with Dark Mode support. 

CSS added a property to detect if the user has dark mode set and set the rules accordingly using the following property:

```
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  //dark mode css rules here
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  //light mode css rules here
}
```

# Things I learned

- Designing for dark mode is not as simple as inverting the colours, if a project involves shadows and depth, just switching the colours would not be enough
- Using a less saturated palette is ideal
- Different shades of grey can be used to communicate depth
- Use contrast ratios higher than 4.5:1 for ancillary text and 15.8:1 for the main text, for accesibility reasons
- All illustrations don't go well with both the schemes
