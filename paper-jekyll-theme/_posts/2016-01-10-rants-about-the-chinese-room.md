It's 2016 already and strong AI is not here yet. We should probably get there. Till we do not, we can endlessly use Philosophy to debate about it. Only problem being, [Newton's flaming laser sword](https://philosophynow.org/issues/46/Newtons_Flaming_Laser_Sword), and that's my beef with most of Philosophy.

We will let that slide. Let Philosophy exist, it helps with intellectual stimulation after all. Question, does philosophy have limits? Logic, maybe? Naah, philosophy ponders about the sound an unobserved tree makes when it falls, if at all. Does not tell you anything about the wave nature of sound but at least makes you question if we are all living in a simulation. Keep 'em existential crises coming.
